I will bear the indignation of the lord, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.” - Micah 7:8, 9</strong></p><p>I am not a great religious scholar to write such a spiritual book. But I have a BIG GOD- Jesus Christ, the Alpha and the Omega, who gave me His grace to write this book. This book contains the teachings taught to me by the Holy Spirit Himself and the words of comfort given by Jesus Christ when I stumbled and fell in my spiritual life and I thought there was no hope or way to rise again.</p><p>You also might be in the same situation of backsliding in your spiritual life,you might have gone far away from Jesus Christ because of your lust, you might have been put to shame by the people around you, you might have been discouraged and depressed by the guilty feelings of your heart, you might have thought that you can never get in line with God and moreover you might be in a situation where no one was there to give you a comforting word; Don’t be troubled, my dear Child. Jesus loves you.</p><p>My dear beloved, when I came across such a situation in my life, Jesus Christ told me this: “My dear son, I still love you a lot”. That’s the word He is telling you this day: “My dear Child, don’t ever forget that I have chosen you. I still love you a lot and I will never cast you away”. Yes, my dear beloved, Jesus Christ loves you a lot. He will set right your Spiritual life. He will lift you up, will enable you to stand and He will certainly keep you with Him forever and ever.</p><p><strong>BEHOLD, THE LORD’S HAND IS NOT SHORTENED, THAT IT CANNOT SAVE; NEITHER HIS EAR HEAVY, THAT IT CANNOT HEAR.” - Isaiah 59:1</strong></p>",
